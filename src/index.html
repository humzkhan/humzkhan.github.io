 <h1>Hi</h1>
 <p>This little codepen project is meant to remind myself of how redux works. It uses the analogy of an insurance company to enhance the clarity of the different functionalities and steps involved in redux. The idea is from a youtube video but anyway I copied it here. Open the console to confirm it is working.</p>
