 <h1>Hi</h1>
 <p>
   This little codepen project is meant to remind myself of how redux works. 
   It uses the analogy of an insurance company to enhance the clarity of the 
   different functionalities and steps involved in redux. The idea is from a 
   youtube video but anyway I copied it here. Open the console to confirm it 
   is working.
</p>
<p>
  Use store.dipatch('some_form_name'('variable(s)')) then 
  console.log(store.getState()) to confirm the object is being updated.
</p>

<h3>
  The Analogy
</h3>
<p>
  The general analogy in regards to the insurance company is: <br>
</p>

<p>
  <div>
    Action Creator = Submitting a form<br>
    Action = Form Types<br>
    Dispatch = Form Receiver sends the form to the different departments<br>
    Reducers = Departments<br>
    State = Outsourced history of all the forms that have ever been processed, visible to all
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  <br>
  
  Someone submits an insurance form to the company. The form receiver takes 
  the form and sends it to all the departments. The departments look at the 
  type of form and act accordingly, updating the necessary information. <br>
  <br> In our case the accounting department will add or subtract money to 
  the bank depending on if a person is joining a policy or a claim is being 
  made. For the claim department they will add a name to their list of claims 
  everytime someone makes a claim. Finally, for the policy department they 
  will add or remove names to the list of policy holders based on if someone
  is joining or canceling a subscription to a policy. <em> Note multiple 
  departments can be working simultaneously after receiving the same form, so
  their is lots of overlap. To account for that all departments are sent a copy 
  of the form each time.</em> The departments update their data by calling on 
  the centralized data held outside the departments, asking for the newest copy 
  then they return the updated version. By having the data outsourced the CEO 
  and other teams can access the data and form a picture of the company more 
  easily.

</p>

<h3>
  Additional Info
</h3>

<p>
  When dispatching an action (form) the combineReducers is the redux function used to link all reducers (send the action to each of the departments).
  The store is another redux function that represents the whole state-tree (the outsourced data the departments access). When store.dispatch(...), is called the state is
  open to being updated by the reducers invoked with the action.<br><br>
